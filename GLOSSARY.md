# Glossary

#### Bluetooth
In general descriptions, we use “Bluetooth.” In more technical documentation, “Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)” can be used for first reference and “BLE” for subsequent references.

#### Code
The numeric code passed from health care professionals to patients who have received a positive test result. We have branded this “COVID Shield code” for clarity. This is referred to in documentation as “One Time Code.”

#### Collect and share
The actions performed by the app (technically, Bluetooth beacons) associated with saving and passing random IDs between nearby phones. “Collected data” refers to all random IDs stored on a user’s phone.

#### COVID-19
We have chosen to use COVID-19 (capitalized) and not “coronavirus” in all instances for specificity and to adhere to observed governmental usage patterns. We avoid “the virus,” “the virus that causes COVID-19,” “disease,” or “SARS-CoV-2” or similar.

#### Diagnosis
Assumes a positive diagnosis from a doctor, but not a positive test result. This should be considered lower confidence than a positive test result. Apps can choose whether to allow only patients with positive test results to receive codes from health care professionals, or also to include patients with positive diagnoses.

#### Exposure
Due to the uncertain relationship between proximity (which we can confirm) and exposure to the virus, “Exposure” should be prefaced by either “potential” (for future-facing possibilities with zero certainty) or “possible” (proximity detected in the past, unclear certainty of exposure). 

“If you have potentially been exposed” (future conditional) and “you have possibly been exposed” (past) can both be used as needed.

An important note: people could be potentially exposed to the virus, not to other people. All references to exposure should focus on COVID-19, not on people.

#### Exposure notification
We consider exposure notification the primary goal of COVID Shield, a technical solution that is complementary to contact tracing, not a replacement.

#### Near/nearby
To demonstrate proximity (and not physical touch or communication), we use the word “near” to describe two people and, if needed, “nearby” as an adjective to be used with phones. We avoid “contact” “close to” “in proximity to” and similar.

#### Notification
Whenever possible, we use “notification” to describe what users might expect to receive. “Notify” can be used where necessary. We avoid the use of the words “alert” and “contact” for their ambiguity and tone. 

#### On/off
Wherever accurate, we use “on” and “off” in place of enable, disable, active, running, etc. 

#### Phones
We have chosen to use the word “phones” instead of “devices” in user-facing language as it’s less technical, more accurate (we expect very little activity through tablets or other devices), and in more common usage.

#### Positive test result
This is a high confidence means for allowing self-reporting. We exclusively refer to the test result itself (“has tested positive for COVID-19” “has received a positive test result for COVID-19”), not to the nature of the person receiving it. We avoid the use of the term “status” (“positive COVID-19 status” “based on your status”). 

#### Random IDs
This is how Apple and Google refer to what is stored on cell phones via the framework. 

#### Risk
We avoid referring to risk. “Potential” (future conditional, zero certainty) and “possible” (past, unclear certainty) can be used instead.

#### (Self-)quarantine/(self-)isolate
Because these terms are used and understood differently in different regions, we have avoided their use within the app. We recommend linking to a regional public health website and following their guidance.

#### Share
“Share” is used in three contexts: as the action to send a link to this app to other potential users; as part of “collect and share,” describing saving and passing random IDs between nearby phones via Bluetooth; and as the action used to upload random IDs from a phone following a positive test result or positive diagnosis. The third action must be authorized by a health care professional.

We avoid “submit,” “upload,” and “report.”

#### Symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, has symptoms
We avoid references to any of these words in favor of plainer language. We use “symptoms” for the government’s symptom checker (“check symptoms”) and symptom tracker (“Track your symptoms”). If references are needed, we recommend “showing symptoms” or “not showing symptoms.”
